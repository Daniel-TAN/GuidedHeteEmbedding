1. grep for [[legacy]], and debug
2. data format change: node_type & train/test (weight in train/test not used )
3. emb_model: w learning
4. support for network embedding only, or supervised task only, without input file constraint.
5. whole candidate set evaluation?
6. support for path selection
7. reduce parameter? like lr_emb
8. model save/loading, including node_type_weight, node biases, etc.


mimic project:

2. compare to other baselines
3. path selection
