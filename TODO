TODO:

1. grep for [[legacy]], and debug
2. add demo
3. change repository name to "GuidedHNE" and make public.

4. data format change: node_type & train/test (weight in train/test not used )
5. whole candidate set evaluation (directly incorporated)
6. richer supervised loss (e.g. logistic loss), and evaluation metrics
